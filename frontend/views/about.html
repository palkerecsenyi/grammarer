<p class="title is-3 tk-rigid-square">About Grammarer</p>
<p>We've all used flashcard tools like <a href="https://quizlet.com/en-gb">Quizlet</a> or <a href="https://www.studyblue.com/">StudyBlue</a> to revise vocab for Greek, Latin and other languages. They are perfect for helping us effectively learn words as well as making the process enjoyable. However, it's not possible to efficiently learn grammar with them. That's why I (Pal Kerecsenyi) made <span class="tk-rigid-square" style="font-weight: bolder">Grammarer</span>.</p>
<p>Users receive a simple 4-digit code on a piece of paper with which they can access the system and track their progress. They can select a grammar list, look at the table, press 'Go!' and test themselves.</p>

<p class="subtitle is-4 tk-rigid-square" style="margin:15px 0 5px">How to use</p>
<p>Once you've signed in with your 4-digit access code, find a grammar list that you want to revise. Click 'Study' in the relevant box, and memorise the table that appears. Once you've done so, press the 'Go!' button below the table. The endings will disappear and a blue square will highlight your position. Once you think you know the ending shown by this highlighter, press <strong>space</strong> to reveal the answer. If you got it right, press the <strong>right arrow</strong> or if you got it wrong, press the <strong>left arrow</strong>. The box will be highlighted green or red (depending on whether you got it right or wrong) and the highlighter will move to the next box. For some grammar lists (like the Greek definite article), the highlighter will move sideways but most of the time it will move downwards.</p>
<p style="margin: 10px 0 0;">Once you've completed the grammar list, the Results box will appear. This shows how many endings you got right, and how many wrong. <strong>Click 'Save!' to finish studying the list.</strong> If you don't do this, you'll lose your score for that session.</p>

<p class="subtitle is-4 tk-rigid-square" style="margin:15px 0 5px;">How it works</p>
<div class="notification is-warning">
    This section explains the technological functionality of this website. Don't bother reading it if you're not interested.
</div>
<p>Grammarer is hosted with <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, a freemium container-based hosting system that's based on Git pushes. Everytime you push code, it rebuilds and deploys (zero downtime). You don't get access to the OS, it's just a hosting system for code. It works with any language. It gives you a subdomain (e.g. 'grammarer.herokuapp.com') and an SSL certificate.</p>
<p style="margin: 10px 0 0;">Grammarer's backend works with NodeJS and Express, like most simple websites. It stores Lists, Users and Results using MongoDB. This is hosted using <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas">MongoDB Atlas</a> (Mongo-as-a-service freemium DB hosting using AWS). In the frontend, it uses AngularJS and a heavily customised version of <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma.CSS</a>. The actual table navigation and marking system is written entirely by me (ðŸ˜„). Surprisingly enough, Greek characters work perfectly without any special accomodation. All authentication happens on the backend, so you can't hijack another account by changing a variable. No data besides the code is stored about users. Nice and simple.</p>

<p class="subtitle is-4 tk-rigid-square" style="margin:15px 0 5px;">Feedback</p>
<p>If you've found an issue with Grammarer, you want me to add another checklist, you've lost your code or you want to tell me how amazing Grammarer is (I already know!), feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:palkerecs@gmail.com">palkerecs@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>Grammarer is made to be as simple as possible and to avoid data protection complications, we store as little data as possible.</p>
