### Full user management system
Grammarer has a full user management system, powered by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Each user is given a 1-7 digit code made of numbers and a prefix to represent the teacher it was assigned by. This allows students to store their progress on the server and access averages and graphs to see their improvement.
